# All You Need is Lambda

A calculus is a method of calculation or reasoning; the lambda calculus is one process for formalizing a method.

The essence of functional programming is that programs are a combination of expressions.

Functional programming languages are all based on the lambda calculus. Some languages in this general category incorporate features into the language that aren't translatable into lambda expressions. Haskell is a pure functional language, because it does not.

The word purity in functional programming is sometimes also used to mean what is more properly called referential transparency.

Beta normal form is when you cannot beta reduce (apply lambdas to arguments) the terms any further.

A combinator is a lambda term with no free variables. Combinators, as the name suggests, serve only to combine the arguments it is given.
