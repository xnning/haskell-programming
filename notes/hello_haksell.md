# Hello Haskell

Reducible expressions are also called redexes.

To return to the Prelude> prompt, use the command :m, which is short for :module. This will unload the file from GHCi.

The results of mod will have the same sign as the divisor, while the result of rem will have the same sign as the dividend.
